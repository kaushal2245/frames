<p><b>THE WORLD CHAMPION</b></p>
<p>Luis Lionel Andres Messi (“Lionel Messi”) is one of, if not, the most popular soccer player in the world. Born on June 24 1987, Messi was the youngest player ever to play for FC Barcelona. At the age of 16, Messi made his first appearance for FC Barcelona. Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina and moved to Spain at the age of 13 where he was offered the chance to train at FC Barcelona’s youth academy. 

At a young age, Messi was diagnosed with hormone deficiency which restricted his growth. Shorter than most of the kids at his age, Messi showed great talent and skills which put him in front of many organizations; one of which was Barcelona. Many organizations showed interest in him but due to his condition, little to no one wanted to pay for Messi’s medical treatment. However, Messi was given a trial with Barcelona where he impressed the coach. Barcelona offered Messi a contract which included Barcelona paying for Messi’s treatment in Spain..</p>
